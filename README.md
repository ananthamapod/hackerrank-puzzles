# Hackerrank coding problems

A collection of the coding challenges I have solved on Hackerrank.

Each challenge is organized as follows:

1.  prompt.pdf - a file containing the problem definition and usage examples given by Hackerrank.
2.  solution.XXX - a file written in the language specified by the extension XXX containing the solution to the problem in that language

**There may be more then one solution file, as the challenge may have been solved in several different languages
